# CarsColor
Project that from photos of cars, estimates its detailed colors (not basic colors) based on the maximum values of the R G B histograms of the photo. A version that uses the same method with HSV values is also provided.

Some systems calculate the color of the car only from the color of the center point of its image (a program that uses this method for verification is attached). Considering the histogram, it is calculated based on the points that are the majority with a certain color

All necessary packages besides:

ultralytics 

cv2

cvzone

math

colorsys

can be installed with a simple pip, if you get the message that you cannot import it

The project uses the colors.csv file downloaded from https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv

Unzip the Test1 file with the test images (obtained from Roboflow and Kaggle)

Execute the python program:

CarsColor_YoloV8n_Min_Distance.py

The photos are shown, to test it, and after close them in console appears the r g b assigned by the max of histograms and the r g b and name of color aproximated in the list of colors in colors.csv.

The photo of the car also appears on the screen and the points that have been considered to establish the color, which are the ROI or region of maximum interest, are marked with white dots.

It also produces the file CarColorResults.txt so that the results can be scored.

Appears the name of the photo  (it matches the license plate of the car) the rgb obtained by applying the maximum histogram of each RGB component and the approximate RGB in the list of colors in color.csv, as well as the name of this color

The results may be tested with  https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html

==========================================================

HSV version:

Execute the python program:

CarsColor_YoloV8n_Min_DistanceHSV.py

The photos are shown, to test it, and after close them in console appears the r g b assigned by the max of histograms and the r g b and name of color aproximated in the list of colors in colors.csv.

The photo is also presented trying to delimit the region of maximum ROI interest, although in this case it is quite blurry.

It also produces the file CarColorResultsHSV.txt so that the results can be scored.

Appears the name of the photo  (it matches the license plate of the car) the rgb obtained by applying the maximum histogram of each HSV component and the approximate RGB in the list of colors in color.csv, as well as the name of this color

==========
Also attached is the CarsColor_YoloV8n_Min_Distance_WithOutHistogram.py program that determines the color of the car based on the color of the center point of the photo. When you run the program, the ROI (point of interest) appears surrounded by a green circle (the results are bad and the central point sometimes coincides with the headlights, windshield, radiators or other points of the car that are not significant for determining its color).

=======================================================================================================================

Before 21/08/2023 there was a more complicated procedure that was abandoned after reading the recent article https://medium.com/@shaw801796/your-first-object-detection-model-using-yolo-2e841547cc20  

OPERATION  BEFORE THE  21/08/2023

It  used the best.pt model that serves to frame the cars in the photos (to see details of its creation with yolov8 see the project
https://github.com/ablanco1950/LicensePlate_Yolov8_MaxFilters)

Create the RandomForest model that from R G B values assigns the name of the color in the colors.csv file

run CreateModelColorsRandomForest.py

run the test

Run CarsColor.py, the photos will appear on the screen for your control, and the assigned colors will appear on the console.

It also produces the file CarColorResults.txt so that the results can be scored.

The result has been:

2122267,251,252,249,['"Snow"']

6662GKS,25,24,28,['"Midnight Blue"']

8544,20,31,39,['"Dark Jungle Green"']

8544,254,255,255,['"White"']

BMW,21,27,34,['"Dark Jungle Green"']

CRAIG,249,211,123,['"Mellow Apricot"']

CY110KS,200,201,203,['"Lilac"']

DRUNK,6,26,100,['"Catalina Blue"']

GCP332,0,131,255,['"Azure"']

GN64OTP,254,254,0,['"Laser Lemon"']

HF3461,14,14,16,['"Smoky Black"']

J75665,182,8,8,['"International Orange (Engineering)"']

J75665,8,8,8,['"Smoky Black"']

LR33TEE,255,3,5,['"Red"']

VIPER,214,95,24,['"Chocolate (Web)"']

VIPER,100,104,107,['"Dim Gray"']


The results can be improved, probably the image segmentation method can be improved. Improvements will be introduced in subsequent editions.

For the recognition of colors based on their R G B components, the web can be used https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
