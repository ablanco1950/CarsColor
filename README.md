# CarsColor
Project that from photos of cars, estimates its detailed colors (not basic colors) based on the maximum values of the R G B histograms of the photo

All necessary packages besides:

ultralytics 

cv2

cvzone

math

can be installed with a simple pip, if you get the message that you cannot import it

The project uses the colors.csv file downloaded from https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv

Unzip the Test1 file with the test images (obtained from Roboflow and Kaggle)

Execute the python program:

CarsColor_YoloV8n_Min_Distance.py

The photos are shown, to test it, and after close them in console appears the r g b assigned by the max of histograms and the r g b and name of color aproximated in the list of colors in colors.csv.

It also produces the file CarColorResults.txt so that the results can be scored.

Appears the name of the photo  (it matches the license plate of the car) the rgb obtained by applying the maximum histogram of each RGB component and the approximate RGB in the list of colors in color.csv, as well as the name of this color

The results may be tested with  https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html

6662GKS,25,24,28,26,36,33,"Dark Jungle Green" ( it should be "Midnight Blue", but the photo is inside a dark garage)

8544,254,255,255,255,255,255,"White" ( Duplicate, the detection recognizes 8544 as car and truck at the same time)

 Before 21/08/2023 there was a more complicated procedure that was abandoned after reading the recent article https://medium.com/@shaw801796/your-first-object-detection-model-using-yolo-2e841547cc20  

Changing the name directory in line 11 of the programa, any directory with any cars fotos can be tested.

=======================================================================================================================
OPERATION  BEFORE THE  21/08/2023

It  used the best.pt model that serves to frame the cars in the photos (to see details of its creation with yolov8 see the project
https://github.com/ablanco1950/LicensePlate_Yolov8_MaxFilters)

Create the RandomForest model that from R G B values assigns the name of the color in the colors.csv file

run CreateModelColorsRandomForest.py

run the test

Run CarsColor.py, the photos will appear on the screen for your control, and the assigned colors will appear on the console.

It also produces the file CarColorResults.txt so that the results can be scored.

The result has been:

2122267,251,252,249,['"Snow"']

6662GKS,25,24,28,['"Midnight Blue"']

8544,20,31,39,['"Dark Jungle Green"']

8544,254,255,255,['"White"']

BMW,21,27,34,['"Dark Jungle Green"']

CRAIG,249,211,123,['"Mellow Apricot"']

CY110KS,200,201,203,['"Lilac"']

DRUNK,6,26,100,['"Catalina Blue"']

GCP332,0,131,255,['"Azure"']

GN64OTP,254,254,0,['"Laser Lemon"']

HF3461,14,14,16,['"Smoky Black"']

J75665,182,8,8,['"International Orange (Engineering)"']

J75665,8,8,8,['"Smoky Black"']

LR33TEE,255,3,5,['"Red"']

VIPER,214,95,24,['"Chocolate (Web)"']

VIPER,100,104,107,['"Dim Gray"']


The results can be improved, probably the image segmentation method can be improved. Improvements will be introduced in subsequent editions.

For the recognition of colors based on their R G B components, the web can be used https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
